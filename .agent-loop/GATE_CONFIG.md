# GATE_CONFIG — Objective Acceptance Gates

**Purpose.** This file is the single source of truth for the _objective_ gates that
decide whether a change in the careviax (PH-OS Pharmacy) agent loop is "done". LLM
review is necessary but never sufficient: a slice is only accepted once the wired
gates below pass with evidence (spec §2.4). Supervisors (claude-lead, codex-lead)
consult this file to pick which gates to run for a given slice and to attach pass/fail
evidence to the RUN ledger.

**How it is used in the loop.**

- After every cheap slice, the owning lane runs the **cheap gates** and records results.
- Before declaring a slice _done_ or proposing a merge, the lane runs the **heavy gates**
  for the impacted area.
- A gate marked `wired: yes` is enforceable today. A gate marked `wired: no` is a known
  gap — it must NOT be reported as passing; reference the TODO instead.

### Gate details

- **lint** — `pnpm lint`. ESLint flat config (eslint@10). Wired. Cheap.
- **format** — `pnpm format:check`. Prettier check (prettier@3.8). Wired. Cheap.
- **typecheck** — `pnpm typecheck`. Runs `next typegen` + `tsc` + `tsc -p tsconfig.sw.json`
  (covers app types + the Serwist service worker). Wired. Cheap.
- **no-unused typecheck** — `pnpm typecheck:no-unused`. Stricter pass that flags unused
  locals/params; added by Codex. Wired. Cheap. Run alongside typecheck on every slice.
- **unit test (targeted)** — `pnpm exec vitest run <impacted files/area>`. Vitest@4. Wired.
  Cheap — run on every slice for the files/areas the change touches.
- **unit test (full)** — `pnpm test` runs the whole Vitest suite (~8k tests). Wired but
  **heavy**: run before declaring a slice done / proposing a merge, or as a periodic broad
  validation — NOT on every slice (it would stall the loop). Evidence recording stays mandatory.
- **build** — `pnpm build`. Next.js 16 production build. Wired. Heavy — run before
  declaring done or proposing a merge, not on every slice.
- **e2e** — `pnpm test:e2e`. Playwright@1.58. Wired but heavy: run for the impacted
  flows/areas, not the full suite on every slice.
- **e2e (audit)** — `pnpm test:e2e:audit`. Audit-focused Playwright config. Wired,
  heavy. Run when the change touches audit-logged or compliance-relevant paths.
- **secret scan** — recommended, NOT yet wired. TODO: add gitleaks (or equivalent) as a
  required pre-commit/CI gate. Until wired, do not claim secret-scan coverage.
- **dependency audit** — `pnpm audit` is available but is not yet a required gate. Run on
  dependency changes and periodically; findings are advisory until promoted to a gate.
- **SAST** — recommended, NOT yet wired. TODO: add static analysis (e.g. semgrep or
  CodeQL) before merge once configured.

## Gate policy (§2.4)

- **Objective gates are the final word.** LLM/code-review (necessary) catches intent,
  taste, and structural issues, but acceptance leans on the wired objective gates above.
  A change is **not "done" on LLM review alone** — the relevant gates must be green with
  recorded evidence.
- **Cheap gates — run every slice:** lint, format, typecheck, no-unused typecheck, and
  **targeted** unit tests (`pnpm exec vitest run` for the impacted files/areas). Fast
  feedback; failing any blocks the slice. (The full Vitest suite is ~8k tests — too heavy
  for every slice; running it per slice would stall the loop or train agents to skip it.)
- **Heavy gates — run before done/merge:** the **full** unit suite (`pnpm test`), build,
  e2e, e2e:audit. Scope e2e to the impacted area to control cost. The full suite may also
  run as a periodic broad validation between slices.
- **Not-yet-wired gates** (secret scan, SAST) and **advisory checks** (`pnpm audit`) must
  be reported honestly: never count an unwired gate as a pass. Wiring them is tracked as
  a TODO and, once done, this table's `Wired` column is updated.
- **Evidence:** every gate run records command + result (pass/fail) into the run ledger;
  a green slice carries the list of gates it passed.
