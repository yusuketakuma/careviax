# Agent Loop — STATE

**Purpose.** Single source of truth for the current loop's runtime state. The two Supervisors
(`claude-lead`, `codex-lead`) read this at the start of every cycle and write it back at the
end. It is the first file consulted on resume and the last file written on a hard-stop.

**How it's used in the loop.**

- At cycle start: read the YAML, confirm `current_run_id` / `current_cycle`, pick up `next_action`.
- During a cycle: update `active_task_id`, `claude_status`, `codex_status` as work proceeds.
- At the gate: write `last_gate_result` (pass | fail | unknown).
- On hard-stop: write the **Resume point** section below so the next session continues cleanly.
- `zero_actionable_count` increments each cycle the queue yields no actionable task; the loop
  idles/backs off when it climbs (see FEATURE_QUEUE.md for intake).
- **Time-elapsed (§14 90-min hard-stop).** `cycle_start_time` is a durable ISO8601 Asia/Tokyo
  timestamp set at run start. At each cycle boundary the Supervisors compute
  `elapsed = now − cycle_start_time`; if `elapsed ≥ 90 min`, trigger a hard-stop (write the
  **Resume point** section, then exit). Because it is persisted here, the budget survives resume —
  do **not** reset it on a mid-run resume; only a fresh run resets it.
- **Files-touched (§14 >20-file hard-stop).** `files_changed_count` is the count of distinct paths
  from `git diff --name-only` measured from the cycle-start tree/commit. Refresh it at each cycle
  boundary; if it exceeds 20, trigger a hard-stop with resume-point persistence (capture
  `active_task_id`, locked paths, and the next command in **Resume point** before exiting).

cycle_start_time: 2026-06-20T00:00:00+09:00 # ISO8601 Asia/Tokyo; reset at each run start. elapsed = now − cycle_start_time, checked at every cycle boundary vs §14 90-min hard-stop

codex_status: waiting_for_patch_review # codex sent rev7 CHANGES_REQUESTED; ledger lock recorded; awaiting rev8 PATCH_REVIEW_REQUEST.
last_memory_bootstrap: 2026-06-20 # Cycle 2 real gbrain recall (CLI). Classified in MEMORY_REVIEW.md; §9/§10 → LOOP_POLICY ApplyNow (codex-approved). `mcp__gbrain__*` after restart.
zero_actionable_count: 1 # queue dry after F-003; idle/backoff per FEATURE_QUEUE intake
last_gate_result: partial_pass # F-007 rev7 objective gates were green, but codex PATCH_REVIEW failed on API/client contract + permission/test blockers.
next_action: await Claude PATCH_REVIEW_REQUEST for F-007 rev8. Review the five blockers: raw dispensing-stats response contract, clerk-support canViewDashboard, report-delivery canSendCareReport, exact 23-entry manifest/provenance, and StatisticsPage permission glue test; also check workflow/intake permission unification and org hydration test.

## gbrain memory (this run)

<!-- Per GBRAIN_SCHEMA.md §15: after each `gbrain put`, append the memory_id (= slug) here so the
     run's durable writeback is auditable. Format: `- <type>: <slug> (<commit>)`. -->

## Resume point

<!-- Written only on hard-stop. Capture: active_task_id, the exact step in progress,
     any locked paths to release, and the single next command/action to take.
     Empty at bootstrap. -->

_(empty)_

> Note: a hard-stop writes the **Resume point** here before exiting so the next session can resume without re-deriving context.
