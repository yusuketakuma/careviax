# Scan Log

## 2026-07-12 — API contract residual scan

- Scope: business-holidays API route, business-holidays admin consumer/tests, shifts consumer/tests, client-schema allowlist, package/CI/build configuration, current Git/Plans/STATE.
- Finding: two frontend list readers trusted compile-time casts; provider has inclusive date bounds and a bounded `limit` without count metadata.
- Classification: `CONTRACT_DRIFT` / `PARTIAL` under `API-CONTRACT-001`; no backend-only or frontend-only feature detected for this slice.
- Implemented: consumed runtime schema, org/date/site/order/identity/cap checks, bounded readers, allowlist ratchet, regression tests.
- Next scan: rescan remaining API-CONTRACT allowlist entries and the patients board cursor residual after this group lands.
