- Branch: `agent/continuous-improvement-20260712`
- Current Task: Round 3 file-complete registry / patient communications RLS-audit / medication-stock performance integration closeout
- Current Commit Group: 3 scoped code commits through `5358c0794` pushed with parity `0 0`; single-ledger commit and non-force push in progress
- Owner / Agent Identifier: `codex1` frontend integration/ledger; `codex2` backend; `codex3` security implementation; `codex4` performance/response improvement via agmsg team `phos`; no mutual review wait
- Resume Token or Session Reference: `019f6053-bcb6-7e40-8b42-f1f18b3fdd9e`
- Notes: Round3 code commits register the fixed file-completion fallback, move patient communications PHI reads into an explicit org transaction with success-only trace audit, and record the medication-stock critical payload budget. Frozen hashes matched all handoffs; each agent's focused/static validation and the serialized aggregate `pnpm typecheck && pnpm typecheck:no-unused` passed. Code commits are pushed with parity `0 0`; mutual review wait is disabled. Oracle and build are prohibited by user policy. Preserve pre-existing dirty `.harness-mem/state/{continuity,whisper-budget}.json`, patient external-share 4 files, and `tools/tests/{helpers/local-auth.ts,ui-major-screens.spec.ts,ui-route-mocked-smoke.spec.ts}`. Stage only explicit owned paths; no `git add -A`.
